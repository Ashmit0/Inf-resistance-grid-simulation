# Inf-resistance-grid-simulation

Problem: 

We wish to analyse an infinite network grid of resistances and simulate the equivalent resistance between the two specific points. 

Procedure: 
1. A python script generates the necessary ltspice netlist for the circuit with user defined length. 
2. Another python script automaticly runs the file created, scraped and saves the necessary data in a csv file.
3. We finally analyse the generated data.
